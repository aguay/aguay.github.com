Sweet Track is a one man band, a craftsman of sound shadow and gloom pop his
music fits somewhere between the lost tapes of your youth and the controversy of
chillwave, creating that familiar yet new sound that's made for basking in
comfortable nostalgia while staying true to its indie self. Expect great things,
starting now.

Two-Way Mirror (Mirror People Remix) "Playful retro fresh-synth work for your
mellow summery beach days under the sunset.""

Two-Way Mirror (What Kind Of Breeze Do You Blow? Remix) "Idiosyncratic
electronic jungle-disco re-orchestration, a robotic re-interpretation of a
mirage."

Two-Way Mirror (Radiant Dragon Remix) "Dramatic recoiling and twinkling night
version with brooding bone-chilling vibe of mysterious cult societies."

Two-Way Mirror (Optimus Prime Remix) "Pulsating mechanical club-ready synth
strutter for the cosmic dancefloors."
