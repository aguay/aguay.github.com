Drawing energy from the static in the air, What Kind Of Breeze Do You Blow? have
found comfort in a new North American home this year where the duo will be
focusing their sorcery on music production for the next few months or so. If
their name is any indication, What Kind Of Breeze Do You Blow? indeed finds
inspiration in weather forecasts, the power of seasons change, clouds
reformation, terrains, habitats and even modern urban structures where every
element in a scenery can aesthetically translate into a beat, sound or a layer
of sound. Melody is the keyword, House and Electronica are the methods; with
each half of the pair bringing their own influences and styles into the
equation, many hard to please journalists have found it difficult to categorize
their sound under one genre as even a simple remix visits different territories
and shifts shape noticeable as it progresses, handing them interesting
descriptions like Tropical-Techno, Melodic-House and Metamorphic-Electronica
while the band simply call it the sound of Benevolence.

They've transformed tracks for The xx, Kings Of Convenience, You Love Her Coz
She's Dead, Yuksek and Lake Heartbeat among others, the latter which loved the
rework done for them so much that they decided to do one in return for the duo
as an act of love and appreciation, it is to date their one and only remix. What
Kind Of Breeze Do You Blow? are releasing their first EP on Brilliantine on the
14th of December with plans for a follow up in the first quarter of 2010.

Although the Love Of Luxury EP offers the first taste of the original sound of
WKBDYB, it is still merely a peek through a keyhole as the possibilities of
their genre adaptations are nothing short of being kaleidoscopically complex â€“
multi bands in one is one way to put it. Like metamorphosis the duo are
unpredictable and will bring genres together as long as the technique can be
mastered.

Debating logic, the title track 'Love of Luxury' feels tribal in its own rights,
a dark quirky synthetic head-trip of clicky beats driven nu-pop proper vocal
song.

Brain slicing electronic dancefloor monster that will appeal to the DJs with a
heavier technological flair, with its ethereally snarly nature and
space-dolphins-ultrasound coating 'The Probe' shall turn your club into a
galactic battle zone.

Like the title implies 'Your Analog #2' is majorly an electronic mood piece
surfing on cosmic waves of ambient doubled with brushes of electric guitar, a
prowling new-age shuttle of sound simulating the ominous feel to venturing into
the unknown.

Remixes come from Tronik Youth transforming the title track into a hauntingly
arcade-hall disco storm of bleeps, coked-up keys and marching band steel drums;
while Lake Heartbeat give it an expert rubdown in ballad territory and smooth
out the experience by laminating it with milky tropical synth and dreamwave
vibes in their only official remix to date.
