Influenced by Factory Records, DFA and Italians Do It Better - Mirror People the
latest project from producer Rui Maia is lathered in layers of synth-rich dark
disco with the potential of taking the full live band form in the near future.
The name 'Mirror People' comes from the song by the 80's band 'Love & Rockets'
while the inspiration for 'Night Impact' came to Rui's mind while listening to
the Mancunian band Section 25.

'Night Impact' is an echo of unplanned nights out, a theatrical lesson in disco
science and a collision of cosmic and mystery synth. It will be released on the
9th of August on Brilliantine via all your favorite digital stores. The single
comes with 4 remixes by Pelifics, CRYSTAL (Institubes), Cosmonaut Grechko and
Sweet Track - along with another original 'Diamonds' as a B-side.
