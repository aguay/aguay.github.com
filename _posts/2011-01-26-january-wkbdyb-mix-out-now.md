title: Here we are

Ola Amigos,
I know it's been a while since our last update but as you see we're back with a new website that will over the next few weeks unveil great surprises for you all! We're on our way to becoming exactly what we wanted, and our promise is releases no less than euphoric. We've been working closely with our friends on perfecting their little aural nuggets and we have tons of amazing people to tag along for remix duties.

Everyone we talk to has a good feeling about 2011, and this is something we share deeply. Things are just getting good. So, expect the best coz we're striving to get your jaw dropped and your brain sparkling.

Stay tuned, good music is coming your way with lots of love.

Brill x

PS. Here's a new mix our friends in What Kind of Breeze Do You Blow? did for winter/summer/whatever it is where you are. It should make you happy. Check it out.
